# SpaceRocks-FinalVersion
SideScrolling GBA Shooter Made by [Stefanos Triantafyllidis](https://github.com/ExStefenGR), [Csaba Maczo](https://github.com/MrMacso) and [Isaac Furieri](https://github.com/isaacfurieri/).

Main game idea and develop of the game made by Stefanos.
Csaba was responsible for creating the arts.

I worked on improving the code and added some features like spaceship health points, power ups and autoplay when idle.
I also created art as the gameplay background.
